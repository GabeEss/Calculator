# Calculator
A calculator made for TheOdinProject foundation course.

The calculator offers keyboard support. 

Things to know:




'n': switches the current number in the display to negative, but not a result.

'=' : gets the answer

'delete'/'backspace' : deletes the last digit/decimal, but it won't delete a result (this is by design).

'c' : clears the display and the stored values

'/' : division

'+' : addition

'*' : multiplication

'-' : subtraction

'.' : decimal

Decimals round to six places once the number of decimal places is over 6. This won't occur for really big numbers.

Note: If you want to change a result, click on an operator first and then you can change it to neg/pos or delete digits.

Known bugs: 

Enter/Return seems to repeat the last button/key press.

The css active button transformations won't work when using keyboard.
