# Calculator
A calculator made for TheOdinProject foundation course.

The calculator offers keyboard support. 

Things to know:




n or +/-: switches the number to negative

= : gets the answer

delete/backspace: deletes the last digit/decimal, but it won't delete a result (this is by design).

c: clears the display and the stored values

/: division

+: addition

*: multiplication

-: subtraction

.: decimal

Decimals round to six places once the number of decimal places is over 6.






Known bugs: Enter/Return creates nine for some reason. The css active button transformations won't work when using keyboard.
